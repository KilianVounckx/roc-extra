# Roc Extra

A [roc](https://www.roc-lang.org) package I made for a few extra convenience
functions.

Roc is an awesome language with an already great standard library! Sometimes, I
find myself wanting even more. This is what this package is for.

This does not mean I want all of the functions in this package to become part
of the standard library. Some are rather niche and definitely don't belong
there.

## Goals

I have no explicit goals for this package. I add functions (maybe some types
later, but I doubt it) where I find myself using some pattern a lot, or if
I think it should be in the standard library for real. Documentation of
functions, which are in that last category, will be tagged with 'stdplz'.

## Non-Goals

One thing I explicitly don't have as a goal is performance. This package is
purely for functionality purposes and not for performance. If you want to
change a function to be more performant, feel free to submit a PR. I will
however often choose clarity over performance.
